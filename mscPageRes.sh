# This could be used (and still had to be extended to account for fitting the width as well) if the resize were so implemented, that it would fill the box. (there is actually a way to force it to do that, using a flag)

#    convert "$i" -resize $NEW_Wx$NEW_H\> "$i";

# But resize is implemented so that the image is fitted into the box. So, it gets simpler:

for i in $FILES; do
    convert "$i" -resize ${WIDTH}x${HEIGHT}\> "$i"; # the \> at the end of the command restricts it to only shrink images to fit into the size given. Never enlarge.
